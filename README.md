# Design

This project is one of the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle has been used in this project.
We will analyze the data to find the relation between the features and use machine learning algorithms that would enable us to predict
if the patient has cardiovascular disease or not.

# Data
The dataset is provided in .csv format. It contains of 70,000 patient record with 13 features for each patients doing cardiovascular disease examination. 
All of the dataset values were collected at the moment of medical examination.
There are 3 types of input features:Objective: factual information, Examination: results of medical examination, and Subjective: information given by the patient.
here are the sample of data set :

The feature list:
•	Age | Objective Feature | age | int (days)
•	Height | Objective Feature | height | int (cm) |
•	Weight | Objective Feature | weight | float (kg) |
•	Gender | Objective Feature | gender | categorical code | 1:women, 2:men
•	Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_hi | int |
•	Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_lo | int |
•	Cholesterol | Examination Feature | cholesterol | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
•	Glucose | Examination Feature | gluc | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
•	Smoking | Subjective Feature | smoke | binary |
•	Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | alco | binary |
•	Physical activity | Subjective Feature | active | binary |
•	Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | cardio | binary |
